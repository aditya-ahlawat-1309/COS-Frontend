# Cloud Operating System

This project is a cloud operating system that provides various features like a file management system, a central app store, an admin panel, CRUD operations, and a Linux terminal. It is designed to run on the frontend and interact with backend APIs.

## Features

- **File Management System:** Browse, upload, download, and manage files in the cloud storage.
- **Central App Store:** Discover and install applications from a central repository.
- **Admin Panel:** Manage user accounts, permissions, and system settings.
- **CRUD Operations:** Perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on files, applications, and other resources.
- **Linux Terminal:** Access a command-line interface to execute commands and perform system operations.

## Getting Started

To get started with this cloud operating system project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/cloud-operating-system.git`
2. Change into the project directory: `cd cloud-operating-system`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Configure the backend API endpoints in the configuration file.
5. Start the development server: `npm start`
6. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to access the cloud operating system.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5 and CSS3 for building the user interface.
- JavaScript and a frontend framework (e.g., React, Angular, Vue.js) for handling dynamic functionality.
- RESTful APIs to communicate with the backend services.
- Integration with third-party libraries for file management, authentication, and other functionalities.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
